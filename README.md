**Macro-fiscal simulation of climate risk and adaptation impacts on sovereign debt**

This model is inspired by the adaptation‚Äìdebt tradeoff pathways introduced in ‚ÄúEnabling Adaptation: Sustainable Fiscal Policies for Climate-Resilient Development‚Äù (UNEP, 2025). It operationalizes the conceptual model from Boxes 1 & 2 into a simulation framework for fiscal policy stress testing under climate risk.

## üìä Indonesia Adaptation Simulation
Purpose: Models the macro-fiscal consequences of recurring climate shocks ‚Äî such as floods and heatwaves ‚Äî on Indonesia‚Äôs GDP, government revenues, spending, and debt-to-GDP ratio.

Features:

Stochastic hazard generation with user-defined frequency and severity.

Fiscal response and adaptation investment pathways with adjustable effectiveness.

Comparative debt trajectories with and without adaptation.

## üìä Macro ‚Üí Corporate Cash Flow Impact Demo
Purpose: Demonstrates how macro-level climate shocks can cascade into corporate P&L impacts for a representative company operating in Indonesia.

Features:

Links macroeconomic variables (GDP shocks, downtime days) to EBIT and free cash flow.

Simulates both shock years and non-shock years over a multi-decade horizon.

Supports visual overlays of hazard frequency and financial drawdowns.
