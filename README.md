**Macro-fiscal simulation of climate risk and adaptation impacts on sovereign debt**

This model is inspired by the adaptation–debt tradeoff pathways introduced in “Enabling Adaptation: Sustainable Fiscal Policies for Climate-Resilient Development” (UNEP, 2025). It operationalizes the conceptual model from Boxes 1 & 2 into a simulation framework for fiscal policy stress testing under climate risk.
